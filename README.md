# Project-Hospital_Information_and_Appointment_Management_System
# Description
#### The Hospital Information & Appointment Management System is a console-based C program designed to simplify the management of patient records and doctor appointments in a hospital environment.
The project demonstrates the use of structures, file handling, modular programming, auto-ID generation, and user-friendly menu design.

This system is suitable for small clinics, diagnostic centers, or hospitals where systematic record-keeping is required.
